        <h1>Welcome to Our Project on Homeownership!</h1>
        <p>Our project explores the various impacts of gentrification on homeownership in cities such as Oakland and San Francisco over the past 10 years. We analyze population aspects like demographic shifts, income changes, housing costs, and crime rates in order to understand how these factors intersect and affect the community. Through comprehensive data analysis and visualizations, we aim to explore the complex dynamics of urban development and its socio-economic consequences.</p>
